## Project Overview
This project is a DIY multi-functional CNC machine capable of both pen plotting and laser engraving.

You can swap between a pen holder (for precision drawing) and a laser module (for engraving and light cutting. Thus, getting the benift of both.

## Research: 2 Hour - 20th May 2025

Spent about two hours researching how laser engravers and pen holders actually work. Brain dump of what learn/ reseached:
-  Stepper motors and belts or screws to control the X and Y axes
-  Running special firmware that interprets G-code 
-  Instructions that tell the machine exactly where to move and when to turn the laser on or lift the pen.
-  pen holder -you need a mechanism to raise and lower the pen so it only touches the paper when itâ€™s supposed to draw
-  This will need ot be able to easily swapped with a laser engraver, a laser diode is mounted instead of the pen
-  Learned a bit about programes such as  Inkscape with plugins, LightBurn, or LaserGRBL
