# Laser-Engraving-Machine
This project is a DIY multi-functional CNC machine capable of both pen plotting and laser engraving.

You can swap between a pen holder (for precision drawing) and a laser module (for engraving and light cutting. Thus, getting the benift of both.

# Motivation
The aim is to develop a cost-effective and versatile CNC device that would incorporate all the characteristics of a pen plotter and a laser engraver. By modularizing the system, you will be able to quickly switch from drawing to engraving, or an array of representative and technical endeavors.

# Tools/Technology needed:
- CAD Software: Fusion 360 (Web Version)
- Firmware: Compatible with GRBL-based controllers
- Control Board: MKS DLC32
- Touchscreen: MKS TS35
- Design Software: Inkscape with plugins, LightBurn, LaserGRBL
